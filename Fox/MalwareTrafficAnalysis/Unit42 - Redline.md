### **Quiz Questions**

#### What is the date and time in UTC the infection started?
The infection began at 2023-07-10 22:39:49 UTC.

#### What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?
We know 10.7.10[.]9 is the DC. When we take a look at the Kerberos CNameString for making requests to the kerberos server we see the 10.7.10[.]47 making requests to the DC (kerberos server).

```
kerberos.CNameString and ip.addr == 10.7.10.47
```

- What is the MAC address of the infected Windows client?
	80:86:5b:ab:1e:c4
- What is the hostname of the infected Windows client?
	desktop-9pea63h
- What is the user account name from the infected Windows host?
	rwalters 

#### What type of information did this RedLine Stealer try to steal

To see what the victim accessed on the web we can use the following filter:

```
(http.request or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)
```

We see 3 unencrypted web requests (HTTP). The first request:
	GET - `guiatelefonos[.]com/data/czx.jpg`
We get redirected to:
	`https://guiatelefonos[.]com:443/data/czx.jpg`

The next 2 HTTP requests go to `623start.site`
	 GET - `/?status=start&av=Windows%20Defender`
	 GET - `/?status=install`
These request seem to give information about the victim. The first request shows what anti-virus is running on the host. And the second gives the status of the malware. 

Next we check the C2 traffic.

```
tcp.flags eq 0x0002 and !(tcp.port eq 443) and !(tcp.port eq 80) and !(ip.dst eq 10.7.10.0/24)
```

We want to filter the start of the connection (SYN packets), which is not web traffic (so not 443 or 80) and is not going inside of our own network (10.7.10.0/24).

The filter `tcp.flags eq 0x0002` in Wireshark corresponds to TCP packets where **only the SYN flag is set**.

The C2 server is at 194.26.135[.]119 : 12432.
It tries to steal:
	- Files from the desktop / documents folder
	- Userdata from the Edge, chromium browser
	- Cryptowallet information
	- API keys
