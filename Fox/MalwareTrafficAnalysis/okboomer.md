What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11[.]94?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Use filter "http.accept_language && ip.addr == 10.11.11.145" to get the user agent of the device. We see it has CrOS which means it runs on Chrome OS on a Chromebook.

What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11[.]121?
----------------------------------------------------------------
We use the same filter "http.accept_language && ip.addr == 10.11.11.121. This time the user agent tells ut the device is a SAMSUNG SM-N950U which is a Galaxy Note 8.

Based on the MAC address for 10.11.11.145, who is the manufacturer or vendor?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We can just filter for "ip.addr == 10.10.11.145" and look at the layer 2 and see it is a Motorola.

What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11[.]179?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We again look at the user agent with "http.accept_language && ip.addr == 10.11.11.179" and we see the device is running macOS 10.15.1 and with the filter "nbns && ip.addr == 10.11.11.179" we can see it is a MacBook-Pro.

What version of Windows is being used on the host at 10.11.11[.]195?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again we look at the user agent with "http.accept_language && ip.addr == 10.11.11.195" to see it uses Windows NT 10.0 which is Windows 10.

What is the user account name used to log into the Windows host at 10.11.11[.]200?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this we can look at SMB traffic, but because this host is not authenticating against SMB we won't find any usernames here. Therefore we look at kerebros traffic. The host does authenticate with the DC or some other resource and reveals it's name. We filter with "kerebros && ip.addr == 10.11.11.200". We then need to look at AS.REQ packets and we see the CNameString of brandon.gilbert.
NEW FILTER WOULD BE "kerebos.CNameString && ip.addr == 10.11.11.200"

What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11[.]217?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again look at the user agent "http.accept_language && ip.addr == 10.11.11.217" and we see iPadOS 13.2.2 on an iPad.

What IP is the Windows host that downloaded a Windows executable file over HTTP?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filter on "ip contains "This program"" to filter on the 'This program cannot be run in DOS mode' string that is in executables. The IP address is 10.11.11.203

What is the URL that returned the Windows executable file?
---------------------------------------------------------------
If we follow the TCP stream we can see in the first packet it is http://acjabogados.com/40group.tiff.

What public IP addresses did that Windows host attempt to connect over TCP after the executable file was downloaded?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we know that the LAN segment range is 10.11.11.0/24 we can filter on only seeing public IP's. "ip.addr == 10.11.11.203 and !(ip.dst == 10.0.0.0/8)". We see the Windows host tries to connect to are 138.201.6.195 and 5.188.108.58.

What is the host name and Windows user account name used on that IP address?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can again filter on kerebos CNameString with "ip.addr == 10.11.11.203 and kerberos.CNameString". The account name is candice.trucker and the host name is TUCKER-WIN7-PC$.
