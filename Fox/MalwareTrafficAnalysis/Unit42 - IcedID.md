**Infection Vector**
At 15:31:08 UTC the victim made a GET request to `hxxp://80.77.25[.]175/main.php`
	`(http.request or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)`

When following this TCP stream we see the victim gets redirected to `hxxps://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/serene-cathode-377701.appspot.com/o/XSjwp6O0pq%2FScan_Inv.zip?alt=media&token=a716bdce-1373-44ed-ae89-fdabafa31c61`
This URL has been reported as malicious on VirusTotal. It is tagged as IcedID malware.

The victim downloaded a .zip file from cotecsecuritygroup[.]com/wicd/643d0491bcea1.zip.
When analyzing this zip file in Virustotal it came back with 31/64 vendors that flagged the file as malicious. It got the label trojan.qakbot.

 
 **IcedID Traffic**
 At 15:35:39 UTC there is a GET request made to `skigimeetroc[.]com`.  When following this TCP stream we see there is a cookie set by the victim and a gzip binary in the stream.
 
 `Cookie: __gads=422998217:1:1808:131; _gid=A0CA96894E9D; _u=4445534B544F502D534646394C4A46:6373696C7661:46353431423635424230383346354633; __io=21_1181811818_1193560798_2439418475; _ga=1.591597.1635208534.1022; _gat=10.0.22621.64`
 
Cookie parameters for the HTTP GET request caused by this IcedID installer follow:

- __gads= IcedID campaign identifier and information from the infected host.
- _gid= Value calculated using MAC address of the infected host.
- _u= ASCII text representing hex values of the victim’s hostname, Windows user account name and another undetermined value.
- __io= Domain identifier from the infected host’s security identifier (SID)
- _ga= Information based on the infected host’s CPU.
- _gat= Windows version. For example, 10.0.22621.64 is an identifier for 64-bit Windows 11 version 22H2 and 10.0.19045.64 is an identifier for 64-bit Windows 10 version 22H2.
