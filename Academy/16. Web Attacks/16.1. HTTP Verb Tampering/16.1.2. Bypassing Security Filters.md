### Overview

- Exploits **insecure coding practices** where filters only process specific HTTP methods.
- Common when security filters validate **only POST parameters**.
- Changing the request method (e.g., to **GET**) can bypass these filters and allow attacks like **Command Injection**.

----

## 1. **Identification**

- File Manager app uses a backend security filter.
- Attempting to create files with special characters (e.g., `test;`) results in:
    - **"Malicious Request Denied!"** message.

- Indicates presence of a **command injection filter** on the server.

## 2. **Exploitation Steps**

### Step 1: Intercept Request

- Use **Burp Suite** to capture a file creation request.

### Step 2: Modify HTTP Method

- Change request method from `POST` to `GET`.

### Step 3: Bypass Confirmed

- Request succeeds.
- File is created despite injection character (`;`) in the name.

### Step 4: Test for Command Injection

- Send a payload: `file1; touch file2;`
- Change method to `GET` and forward the request.
- **Result: Both `file1` and `file2` created** â†’ confirms command injection.
