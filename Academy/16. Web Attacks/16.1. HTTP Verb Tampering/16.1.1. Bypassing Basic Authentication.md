### Overview

- Exploits **HTTP Verb Tampering** to bypass **HTTP Basic Authentication**.
- Vulnerability often stems from **insecure web server configurations** or **poorly implemented authentication logic**.
- Common in pages that restrict certain HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) but neglect others (e.g., HEAD, OPTIONS).

---

## 1. **Identification**

- File Manager app allows adding files.
- Clicking **Reset** triggers authentication prompt:
    - Page: `/admin/reset.php`
    - Auth required for `/admin/` directory.

- Unauthorized access yields `401 Unauthorized`.

---

## 2. **Exploitation Steps**

### Step 1: Identify Request Method

- Reset function uses a **GET** request.
- Intercept using **Burp Suite**.

### Step 2: Try a **POST** request

- Change method to `POST` in Burp.
- Result: Still prompts for credentials â†’ **403/401** response.

### Step 3: Check for Allowed Methods

- Send `OPTIONS` request:
```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```
- Response includes:
```vbnet
Allow: POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, GET
```

### Step 4: Try a **HEAD** request

- HEAD mimics GET but returns **no body** in the response.
- Change method to `HEAD` and forward the request.

- Result:
    - No prompt, no error.
    - **Function is executed silently.**
    - Return to app: **All files are deleted**.

----
## 3. **Key Learnings**

- HEAD requests are often accepted by default and may bypass restrictions.
- Authentication mechanisms may not enforce access control uniformly across HTTP methods.
- Web servers must be explicitly configured to **restrict all HTTP methods**.
