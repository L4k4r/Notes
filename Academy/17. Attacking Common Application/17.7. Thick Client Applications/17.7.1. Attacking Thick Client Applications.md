### **Overview**

- _Thick Client Applications_: Locally installed apps performing most processing on client-side
- Languages: _Java_, _.NET_, _C++_, _Silverlight_
- Examples: _Media players_, _Chat software_, _Video games_, _Enterprise software_
- Common features:
    - **Work offline**
    - **Store data locally**
    - **Consume more resources**
    - **Harder to patch/update**
    - **More expensive & less secure than thin clients**

---

### **Architectures**

- **Two-Tier Architecture**:
    - App ↔ Database (direct connection)
- **Three-Tier Architecture**:
    - App ↔ Application Server ↔ Database
    - More secure, no direct DB communication

---

### **Common Vulnerabilities**

- _Hardcoded sensitive data_
- _DLL Hijacking_
- _Buffer Overflow_
- _SQL Injection_
- _Insecure Storage_
- _Improper Error Handling_
- _Poor Session Management_

---

### **Penetration Testing Process**

#### **1. Information Gathering**

- Identify:
    - Architecture
    - Tech stack & frameworks
    - Entry points and data flows

- Tools:
    - _CFF Explorer_
    - _Detect It Easy (DIE)_
    - _ProcMon_
    - _Strings_

#### **2. Client-Side Attacks**

- Review stored credentials, tokens, config data
- Perform _static analysis_ (e.g. reverse engineering EXE/DLL/JAR/CLASS)
- Perform _dynamic analysis_ (e.g. memory inspection)
- Tools:
    - _Ghidra_, _IDA_, _OllyDbg_, _Radare2_
    - _dnSpy_, _x64dbg_, _JADX_, _Frida_

#### **3. Network Attacks**

- Analyze communication with backend
- Capture traffic over HTTP/HTTPS or TCP/UDP
- Tools:
    - _Wireshark_, _tcpdump_
    - _TCPView_, _Burp Suite_

#### **4. Server-Side Attacks**

- Test for web-app style vulnerabilities (e.g. OWASP Top Ten)

### **Example: Extracting Hardcoded Credentials**

#### **Initial Foothold**

- Accessed _NETLOGON_ share via SMB
- Found and downloaded `RestartOracle-Service.exe`

#### **Dynamic Analysis**

- Used _ProcMon64_ to monitor execution
- Located `.bat` file dropped in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\2`
- Modified folder permissions to preserve dropped files

#### **Batch File Inspection**

- Logic checks for specific usernames
- Writes _base64-encoded binary_ to `oracle.txt`
- Uses PowerShell (`monta.ps1`) to decode `oracle.txt` into `restart-service.exe`
- Deleted all intermediate files

#### **Reverse Engineering Workflow**

1. **Prevent deletion**: Removed deletion lines in `.bat`
2. **Recovered files**: `oracle.txt`, `monta.ps1`, and `restart-service.exe`
3. **Analyzed with**:
    - _x64dbg_: Located _memory-mapped_ `.NET` executable
    - _Dumped memory region_ containing MZ header

4. **Used Tools**:
    - _De4dot_: Deobfuscated `.NET` binary
    - _dnSpy_: Revealed source code

#### **Findings**

- Revealed hardcoded credentials in a custom `runas.exe` clone used to restart Oracle service

### **Key Takeaways**

- Thick clients offer a wide attack surface:
    - Local binaries
    - Stored secrets
    - Client-server traffic

- Static & dynamic analysis are crucial
- Weak file & process hygiene can lead to credential disclosure
- Many enterprise thick clients still rely on insecure design patterns
