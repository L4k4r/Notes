- Revenue: ~$2.4 billion | Clients: _92 of the Fortune 100_
- Splunkbase: App/add-on marketplace with _2,000+ items_
- Known CVEs: _47 total_; few are exploitable
    - Notable:
        - _CVE-2018-11409_ (Info Disclosure)
        - _CVE-2011-4642_ (Authenticated RCE – very old)

### **Discovery**

- Default Web Interface: `http://<ip>:8000`
- Management Port: _8089_ (Splunk REST API)
- Default Creds (Older Versions): `admin:changeme`
    - Latest versions prompt user to set creds at install

- Trial installs revert to _Splunk Free_ after 60 days:
    - **No authentication** required
    - Leads to potential unauthorized access

#### **Nmap Service Detection**
```bash
sudo nmap -sV <target-ip>
```
Example output:
```bash
8000/tcp open  ssl/http      Splunkd httpd
8089/tcp open  ssl/http      Splunkd httpd
```

    - Install apps from Splunkbase
    - Deploy **custom applications**

- **Scripted Inputs**:
    - Designed to fetch data from APIs or files
    - Support _Bash, Batch, PowerShell, Python_ scripts
    - Useful vector to gain **RCE**

- All Splunk installs include Python → _portable exploit path_

### **Common Attack Vectors**

- Abuse **scripted inputs** for Python/Bash reverse shells
- Install a custom Splunk app with malicious logic
- Exploit SSRF or misconfigured **REST API endpoints**
- Check for **Splunk Free** version deployments with no auth
