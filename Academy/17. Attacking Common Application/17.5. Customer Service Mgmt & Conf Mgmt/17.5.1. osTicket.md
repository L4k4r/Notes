### **Overview**

- _Open-source support ticketing system_ used for integrating email, phone, and web forms
- Written in _PHP_ with a _MySQL_ backend
- Comparable to: _Jira, OTRS, Request Tracker, Spiceworks_
- Widely used by _schools, companies, universities, local governments_
- Featured in _Mr. Robot_
- Focus: _sensitive data exposure_, _credential leakage_, _internal resource discovery_

---

### **Footprinting & Discovery**

- **Indicators**:
    - Web page footer: “_Powered by osTicket_”
    - Cookie: `OSTSESSID` set on visit

- **Nmap**: Web server info only (Apache/IIS), not specific to osTicket
- **OSINT**:
    - Used to gather info through ticketing interface
    - _Open-source_ nature allows thorough study of functionality

---

### **Social Engineering Angle**

- **Ticketing systems** process:
    1. _User Input_: User reports a technical issue
    2. _Processing_: Staff attempts to reproduce the error internally
    3. _Solution_: May involve technical staff, creating opportunities to harvest info

- Techniques:
    - Feign confusion or technical error to elicit information
    - Trigger communication that may include valid internal _email addresses_ or _usernames_

### **Exploitation Paths**

#### **1. SSRF Vulnerability (CVE-2020-24881)**
- Affects osTicket v1.14.1
- May be leveraged to:
    - Access internal resources
    - Perform internal port scans

#### **2. Email Hijacking for External Services**
- Ticketing systems may assign _temporary internal emails_ (e.g., `940288@inlanefreight.local`)
- Use case:
    - Register with these on exposed platforms (e.g., Slack, GitLab)
    - Intercept signup confirmations via osTicket portal

#### **3. Compromised Credentials + Portal Access**
- Use tools like _Dehashed_ to obtain leaked credentials
- Combine with _subdomain enumeration_ to identify services
    - Example subdomains:
        - `support.inlanefreight.local` → osTicket instance
        - `vpn.inlanefreight.local` → SSL VPN

- Attempt login using:
    - `email: kevin@inlanefreight.local`
    - `password: Fish1ng_s3ason!` → **Success**

---

### **Sensitive Data Exposure Example**

- Logged in as support agent with no open tickets
- One closed ticket reveals:
    - A _standard password_ used for VPN password resets
    - Password: `Pwn3d_by_PRTG!`

- Actions:
    - Use credential on VPN portal
    - Attempt password spraying against other users using known format

---

### **Enumeration Tips**

- **Extract Emails**:
    - Address book can reveal usernames/emails for password spraying

- **Password Patterns**:
    - Look for common formats: `Welcome1`, `CompanyName2023`, `Spring2024!`, etc.

### **Mitigation Recommendations**

- Restrict external exposure of sensitive applications
- Enforce _multi-factor authentication_ (MFA)
- Educate employees on:
    - Not using corporate email on third-party sites
    - Handling password reset requests securely

- Apply strict password policies:
    - Ban weak/common patterns
    - Require periodic changes

- Force password change on first login
