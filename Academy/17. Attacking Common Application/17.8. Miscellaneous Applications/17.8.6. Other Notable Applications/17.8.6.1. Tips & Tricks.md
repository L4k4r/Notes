### **Key Takeaways**

- This module emphasizes a _methodology_ for assessing applications, not just individual exploit techniques.
- Focused on:
    - Network enumeration
    - Visual application mapping
    - Exploiting common functionality and default misconfigurations

- Critical to _adapt to unknowns_ and apply fundamental techniques to discover vulnerabilities in lesser-known or custom applications.

### **Mindset for Success**

- Penetration testing is about:
    - **Curiosity** in unfamiliar systems
    - **Digging into scan output** beyond surface-level results
    - Recognizing **low-hanging fruit** like:
        - Default credentials
        - Exposed Git repositories
        - Forgotten admin panels

### **Examples of Application Types**

|Application|Abuse Info|
|---|---|
|**Axis2**|Often on Tomcat; check for weak/default creds. Upload `.aar` webshell. Metasploit support.|
|**Websphere**|RCE via WAR file if admin panel (system:manager) is exposed.|
|**Elasticsearch**|Vulnerable older installs common. Review EyeWitness and forgotten hosts. Featured on HTB's _Haystack_.|
|**Zabbix**|Known issues: SQLi, RCE, LDAP disclosure. Built-in functionality abuse possible. See HTB _Zipper_.|
|**Nagios**|Numerous vulnerabilities: RCE, XSS, privilege escalation. Check for `nagiosadmin:PASSW0RD`.|
|**WebLogic**|190+ CVEs including unauthenticated Java deserialization RCEs.|
|**Wikis/Intranets**|Look for document repositories & search features leaking credentials (e.g., SharePoint, MediaWiki).|
|**DotNetNuke**|Past issues: auth bypass, XSS, file upload bypass. CMS written in .NET.|
|**vCenter**|High-value asset. CVE-2021-22005 (OVA upload RCE). Often runs with high privileges. Simple privilege escalation if shell is obtained.|

### **Conclusion**

- Always consider:
    - **Built-in functionality** that enables RCE
    - **Default configurations and credentials**
    - **Credential reuse** across applications

- The methodology taught applies to:
    - Custom applications
    - Internal tools
    - Niche enterprise software
