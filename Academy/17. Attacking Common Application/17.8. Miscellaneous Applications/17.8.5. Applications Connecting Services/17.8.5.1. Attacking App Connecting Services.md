### **Overview**

- Applications often contain _connection strings_ for connecting to backend services.
- If connection strings or credentials are improperly secured, attackers can extract and reuse them.
- Targets can include databases, APIs, or internal services.

---

### **ELF Executable Examination**

**Binary**: `octopus_checker`
- Connects to a **SQL Server** instance using ODBC.
- On execution:
```rust
[unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open lib 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server'
```
- Suggests an internal SQL connection attempt.

**Using GDB for Analysis:**
```bash
gdb ./octopus_checker
```
- Set disassembly flavor to Intel:
```bash
set disassembly-flavor intel
disas main
```

**Identify Function Call:**

- Look for call to:
```assembly
SQLDriverConnect@plt
```

**Inspect Registers at Breakpoint:**
```assembly
RDX: "DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=localhost,1401;UID=username;PWD=password;"
```
- Reveals full **SQL connection string**, including `username` and `password`.

### **Reusing Extracted Credentials**

- Attempt **authentication reuse** for lateral movement.
- Test credentials across:
    - Internal MSSQL services
    - SMB shares
    - Web interfaces
    - VPNs or RDP gateways


---

### **DLL File Examination**

**Target**: `MultimasterAPI.dll`
- .NET assembly file located on a remote host.
- Use `Get-FileMetaData` to inspect:
```powershell
Get-FileMetaData .\MultimasterAPI.dll
```
**Indicators:**
- Framework: `.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8081/api/getColleagues`

**Reverse Engineering with dnSpy:**
- Load DLL into dnSpy.
- Navigate: `MultimasterAPI.Controllers -> ColleagueController`
- Discover **hardcoded database connection string**, includes:
    - Server
    - Username
    - Password


---

### **Post-Exploitation Actions**

- **Connect to the database** using extracted credentials.
- Perform:
    - Privilege escalation
    - Enumeration
    - Lateral movement

- Consider:
    - **Password spraying**
    - Credential reuse across other services

---

### **Best Practices for Defense**

- Avoid hardcoding credentials.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults.
- Monitor application binaries for sensitive data.
- Employ least privilege for service accounts.
- Encrypt configuration files where possible.
