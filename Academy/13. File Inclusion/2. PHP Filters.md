### Overview

- PHP is commonly used in modern web applications, including frameworks like _Laravel_ and _Symfony_.
- When an **LFI vulnerability** is found, **PHP wrappers** can extend exploitation.
- PHP wrappers provide access to various _I/O streams_, useful for both developers and attackers.
- Used in attacks like _LFI_ and _XXE_ for **source code disclosure** or **remote code execution**.

## Input Filters

### Filter Wrapper Basics

- Accessed using the `*php://filter/*` scheme.
- Key parameters:
    - `*resource*`: Target file or stream
    - `*read*`: Type of filter to apply
- Relevant filter for LFI: `*convert.base64-encode*` (under _Conversion Filters_)
    - Allows encoding of target PHP files to prevent them from being executed.

----
## Fuzzing for PHP Files

### Discovery Phase

- Use tools like **ffuf** or **gobuster** to find accessible PHP files:
```bash
ffuf -w <wordlist>:FUZZ -u http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ.php
```
- Collect all status codes: 200, 301, 302, 403.
- Use discovered files to recursively identify other references.

---
## Standard PHP Inclusion

### Normal LFI Behavior

- Including `.php` files without filters executes them.
- Example: `config.php` returns nothing if it only contains logic/setup without HTML.
- This limits our ability to extract sensitive logic or credentials.

---
## Using Base64 Filter

### Bypassing PHP Execution

- Use the base64 filter to prevent execution and read raw source code:
```bash
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config
```
- `.php` is auto-appended, making the target file `config.php`.

### Decoding Output

- Extract encoded string from LFI result:
```bash
echo 'PD9waHAK...SNIP...KICB9Ciov' | base64 -d
```
- Reveals full PHP source code including:
	- Headers
	- Routing logic
	- Credential storage

## Key Takeaways

|Goal|Method|
|---|---|
|Avoid PHP execution|Use `convert.base64-encode` with `php://filter`|
|Discover PHP files|Fuzz with tools like **ffuf**, capture all HTTP status codes|
|Read source from LFI|Append filter to inclusion string, decode output|
|Analyze app internals|Review decoded source for logic, credentials, and file references|
