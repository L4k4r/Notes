### **Understanding `$PATH`**

- `$PATH`: environment variable listing directories for command lookup
    - E.g., `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games`

- Commands are executed by searching the first matching executable in the listed directories

---

### **Basic Exploitation of PATH**

- If a user/script calls a command without specifying the full path, the system checks each `$PATH` entry in order
- If a directory in `$PATH` is writable, attacker can place a malicious binary/script with the same name as a legitimate command
- The system will execute the malicious file instead of the real one

---

### **Demonstration: Custom Script in PATH**

- Script `conncheck` created in `/usr/local/sbin`
- Executing `conncheck` from any directory (e.g., `/tmp`) still runs due to PATH inclusion

```bash
# conncheck script example output:
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
...
```


---

### **Adding `.` (current directory) to `$PATH`**

- Risky practice: allows execution of binaries/scripts in current working directory
- Modified using:
```bash
PATH=.:$PATH
export PATH
```

- Allows attacker to override commands like `ls`:
```bash
echo 'echo "PATH ABUSE!!"' > ls
chmod +x ls
```

- Running `ls` now executes the local malicious script:
```bash
PATH ABUSE!!
```


---

### **Security Implications**

- PATH abuse can be leveraged for:
    - **Privilege Escalation**: especially in scripts run by `root` referencing unsanitized commands
    - **Persistence**: if system-wide scripts are modified

- Detectable by inspecting:
    - `echo $PATH`
    - User/script-defined environment variables
    - Write permissions to directories in `$PATH`


---

### **Mitigation**

- Avoid adding `.` to `$PATH`
- Use full paths for command calls in scripts (e.g., `/bin/ls`)
- Restrict write access to PATH directories
- Audit scripts and binaries for unsafe PATH usage
