#### **Overview**

The **Kerberos "Double Hop" problem** occurs when trying to authenticate across **multiple servers** using Kerberos. Unlike NTLM authentication, where credentials are cached and reused, Kerberos **only grants a ticket** for a **specific resource** (i.e., one machine). If an attacker tries to use **WinRM or PowerShell Remoting**, they may face access denial due to missing Kerberos credentials when trying to reach another host.


---

### **1. Why Does This Problem Occur?**

- **Kerberos authentication does not cache the password**, only a ticket (TGS) for the current session.
- When authenticating via **WinRM**, the **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is not forwarded**.
- As a result, attempting to access another resource (e.g., a Domain Controller) fails because there is **no valid ticket** for that second resource.

 **Example Scenario:**

- **Attack Host → DEV01 → DC01**
- The attacker logs into **DEV01** via **evil-winrm** or **Enter-PSSession**.
- When trying to query **Active Directory on DC01**, authentication fails because the user's **TGT was not sent**.

 **Symptoms of the Double Hop Issue:**

- Kerberos authentication works for the first hop (DEV01).
- **No credentials are stored in memory** (verified using **Mimikatz**).
- Any command requiring authentication to another host **fails**.
---

### **2. Unconstrained Delegation & Why It Matters**

- If **unconstrained delegation** is enabled, the **TGT is forwarded**, allowing access to the second host.
- If you compromise a machine with **unconstrained delegation**, you can **impersonate users** and move laterally **without facing the double hop issue**.

### **3. Workarounds for the Double Hop Problem**

There are **two main solutions**:

#### Workaround #1: Use a PSCredential Object

**Concept:**  
Since credentials aren't stored in memory, explicitly pass credentials in every request.

 **Steps:**

1. Convert the password into a **secure string**:
```powershell
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force

$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)
```

2. Run **PowerView** commands with authentication:
```powershell
get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname
```
If the **-credential flag is not used**, the command **fails** again.

**Effectiveness:**
- Works when using **evil-winrm** or **Enter-PSSession**.
- Must **manually include credentials** for every request.


#### Workaround #2: Register a PSSession Configuration
 
**Concept:**  
Create a **PowerShell session configuration** that runs commands in the context of the target user.

**1. Establish a WinRM session**:
```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Credential inlanefreight\backupadm
```

**2. Verify the problem** by checking for Kerberos tickets:
```powershell
klist
```
If only an **HTTP service ticket** is present, the **double hop problem** still exists.

**3. Register a new PSSession configuration**:
```powershell
Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm
```

**4. Restart WinRM** to apply changes:
```powershell
Restart-Service WinRM
```

**5. Reconnect using the new session configuration**:
```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName backupadmsess
```

**6. Verify the issue is resolved**:
```powershell
klist
```
If a **krbtgt ticket** is present, the issue is resolved.

**7. Run PowerView commands normally** without specifying credentials:
```powershell
get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname
```

**Effectiveness:**
- Works when using **Enter-PSSession** from **Windows attack hosts**.
- **Does not work from evil-winrm** (requires GUI for authentication).
- Works well when using **RDP or domain-joined Windows hosts**.

### **4. Alternative Solutions**

 **CredSSP Authentication**:
- Enables authentication delegation but requires **manual configuration**.  
**Port Forwarding**:
- Tunnel connections through an intermediate host to avoid authentication issues.  
**Sacrificial Process Injection**:
- Inject into a process running as the target user to inherit their authentication.

---

### **5. Key Takeaways**

 **Understanding the Issue**:

- Kerberos **does not cache passwords**; only tickets.
- The **TGT is not forwarded**, causing authentication failures.

 **Solutions**:

1. **PSCredential Object** → Works but requires manual authentication on each request.
2. **Register-PSSessionConfiguration** → Works for domain-joined hosts but **not via evil-winrm**.

 **Best Use Cases**:

- **Evil-winrm access?** → Use **PSCredential Object**.
- **Windows attack host?** → Use **Register-PSSessionConfiguration**.
