#### **Overview of ACLs in Active Directory**

- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** control who has access to objects in Active Directory (AD) and at what level.
- **Access Control Entries (ACEs)** define permissions for users, groups, or processes.
- ACL misconfigurations can leak permissions and pose security threats.

#### **Types of ACLs**

1. **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)** – Defines who is granted or denied access to an object.
2. **System Access Control List (SACL)** – Used for auditing access attempts.

#### **Types of ACEs**

1. **Access Denied ACE** – Explicitly denies access.
2. **Access Allowed ACE** – Explicitly grants access.
3. **System Audit ACE** – Logs access attempts for auditing.

Each ACE contains:

- Security identifier (SID) of the user/group.
- ACE type (allowed, denied, or audit).
- Flags for inheritance (whether child objects inherit permissions).
- Access mask (32-bit value defining specific rights).

#### **Why ACLs & ACEs Matter**

- Attackers exploit ACL misconfigurations for **lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistence**.
- Many organizations are unaware of existing ACE permissions.
- Can’t be easily detected by vulnerability scanners.

#### **Common ACL-Based Attacks**

4. **ForceChangePassword** – Allows resetting a user's password without knowing the current one.
5. **GenericWrite** – Allows modifying an object’s attributes, enabling attacks like Kerberoasting.
6. **AddSelf** – Enables adding oneself to security groups.
7. **GenericAll** – Grants full control over an object, allowing privilege escalation.

#### **Enumeration & Exploitation Tools**

- **BloodHound** – Visualizes ACL relationships.
- **PowerView** – Enumerates and abuses ACLs.
- **GMSAPasswordReader** – Reads Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) passwords.

#### **Real-World ACL Attack Scenarios**

|**Attack**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Abusing Forgot Password Permissions**|IT staff may have permissions to reset passwords, enabling an attacker to reset a privileged account's password.|
|**Abusing Group Membership Management**|Attackers can add themselves to high-privilege groups.|
|**Excessive User Rights**|Legacy or misconfigured settings may grant users unintended privileges.|

#### **Key Takeaways**

- ACL misconfigurations provide opportunities for privilege escalation.
- Regular ACL audits are necessary to prevent exploitation.
- Tools like **BloodHound** and **PowerView** help identify ACL-based attack paths.
- Persistence techniques include modifying ACLs to maintain unauthorized access.
