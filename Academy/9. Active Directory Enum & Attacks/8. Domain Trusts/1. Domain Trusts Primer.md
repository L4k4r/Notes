### **Why Do Domain Trusts Exist?**

Organizations **merge, acquire companies, or set up partnerships** that require **users from different domains** to access shared resources. Instead of **migrating** everything, **trust relationships** allow for seamless authentication between domains.

However, **misconfigured trusts** can become a major **security risk**, allowing attackers to **pivot** between domains, escalate privileges, and even **compromise an entire forest**.

----
## 1 Types of Domain Trusts

A **trust relationship** defines how authentication requests are handled between two domains or forests. The key trust types include:

### Parent-Child Trust
- **Default trust** when a new child domain is created.
- **Bidirectional** and **transitive**.
- Example:
    - **`corp.inlanefreight.local`** (child)
    - **`inlanefreight.local`** (parent)

### Cross-Link Trust
- **Direct trust between child domains** to improve authentication speeds.
- **Bidirectional** and **transitive**.
- **Prevents authentication delays** across large forests.

### External Trust
- **Manually created trust** between **two separate forests**.
- **Non-transitive** (restricted only to the specified domains).
- Uses **SID filtering** to prevent unauthorized access.

### Tree-Root Trust
- **Automatically created** when a new tree root domain is added.
- **Bidirectional & transitive**.

### Forest Trust
- **Manually created trust** between **two different forests**.
- **Transitive** and **can be bidirectional or one-way**.

### **ESAE Trust (Enhanced Security Admin Environment)**
- Used for **bastion forests** (secure management of Active Directory).

## 2️ Trust Directions

Trusts define **who can access what** based on their **direction**.

### One-Way Trust
- **Users in Domain A** can **access Domain B**, but **not vice versa**.
- Example:
    - **`inlanefreight.local`** → trusts → **`partner.company.local`**
    - But **`partner.company.local`** cannot authenticate into **`inlanefreight.local`**.

### Bidirectional Trust
- **Users in both domains** can **access each other’s resources**.


## Transitive vs Non-Transitive Trusts

- **Transitive Trust:** Extends trust to **child domains**.
    - Example: **A → B, B → C** → A **automatically trusts** C.
- **Non-Transitive Trust:** Only applies to the **specified domains**.
    - Example: **A → B** does **not** mean **A → C**.


## Security Risks of Domain Trusts

**M&A Risks:**
- When a **large organization** acquires a smaller one, trust relationships may **introduce vulnerabilities** from a **weaker security environment**.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Attackers in **one domain** can pivot into **another trusted domain**.

**Kerberoasting from a Trusted Domain:**
- An attacker can **Kerberoast a service account** from a **subdomain** to **compromise the parent domain**.

 **Unaware Trust Relationships:**
- Companies may **not even know** that certain trusts exist!

# Enumerating Trust Relationships

### 1 Using PowerShell (Get-ADTrust)

- **Native method** (built-in Active Directory module).
- Lists **trust direction, transitivity, and trust type**.
```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory Get-ADTrust -Filter *
```
**Example Output:**
```powershell
Direction               : BiDirectional
Source                  : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Target                  : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType               : Uplevel
ForestTransitive        : False
```

### 2 PowerView (Get-DomainTrust)

- **More advanced enumeration** than `Get-ADTrust`.
- Works **without domain admin** privileges.
```powershell
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1 Get-DomainTrust
```
**Example Output:**
```powershell
SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
```

### 3 PowerView (Get-DomainTrustMapping)

- **Enumerates multiple trust paths**.
- Helps in **identifying pivot points**.
```powershell
Get-DomainTrustMapping
```
**Example Output:**
```powershell
SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
```

----
### 4 Enumerating Users in a Trusted Domain

- If we have **basic user access**, we can **query other domains**.
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Domain LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL | select SamAccountName
```

### 5 Using Netdom

- **Windows built-in tool** for querying domain relationships.
```powershell
netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local trust
```

- Enumerate Domain Controllers
```powershell
netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local dc
```
- Enumerate Workstations & Servers
```powershell
netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local workstation
```

## **Key Takeaways**

 - **Misconfigured domain trusts** create **attack paths**.  
- **Parent-child trusts** allow **privilege escalation**.  
- **External trusts** might allow **password spraying & Kerberoasting**.  
- **Using BloodHound, PowerView, and netdom** helps **map trust relationships**.  
- **Attackers can pivot across domains** if **trusts are bidirectional & transitive**.
