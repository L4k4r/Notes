### Overview

- Many web apps use **front-end JavaScript** to restrict uploaded file types (e.g., images only).
- These validations can be **bypassed**, as they occur in the **client's browser** and not on the back-end.
- Upload bypass methods:
    - **Modifying HTTP requests**
    - **Disabling front-end validation**

---

## Bypassing Client-Side Validation

### 1. Back-End Request Modification

#### Steps

1. Use **Burp Suite** to capture the upload request.
2. Modify:
    - `filename="shell.php"`
    - File content to a **PHP web shell** (e.g., `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`)
3. Forward the modified request.

#### Outcome
- If back-end has **no file-type validation**, upload succeeds.
- File is saved and accessible (e.g., `/profile_images/shell.php`).
- Shell can be triggered with `?cmd=<command>`.

### 2. Disabling Front-End Validation

#### Steps

1. Open **Page Inspector**: `[CTRL+SHIFT+C]`
2. Locate file input:
```html
<input type="file" ... onchange="checkFile(this)" accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png">
```
3. Remove:
    - `onchange="checkFile(this)"`
    - Optional: `accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png"`
4. Select PHP shell and upload.
#### JavaScript Function Example
```javascript
function checkFile(File) {
  if (extension !== 'jpg' && extension !== 'jpeg' && extension !== 'png') {
    $('#error_message').text("Only images are allowed!");
    File.form.reset();
    $("#submit").attr("disabled", true);
  }
}
```
#### Outcome
- JavaScript checks are **bypassed**.
- File uploads without triggering restrictions.

Note: Changes are **temporary** and will reset on page reload. Only needed to bypass validation once.

## Notes

- **Client-side validation** is easily bypassed and should **never be relied on for security**.
- Server-side validation is essential to:
    - Enforce file extensions and MIME types
    - Sanitize file contents
    - Restrict upload directories and file access
