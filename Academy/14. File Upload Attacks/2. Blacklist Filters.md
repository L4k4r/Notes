### Overview

- Some web apps validate file uploads using **blacklists** (disallowed extensions).
- This approach is flawed and **incomplete**—easily bypassed using non-blacklisted but still executable extensions.
---

## Back-End Blacklisting Example

```php
$fileName = basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);
$extension = pathinfo($fileName, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
$blacklist = array('php', 'php7', 'phps');

if (in_array($extension, $blacklist)) {
    echo "File type not allowed";
    die();
}
```
### Weaknesses:

- Incomplete: misses valid executable extensions like `.phtml`, `.php5`
- **Case-sensitive**: may allow `pHp`, `Php`, etc.
- Bypassed by using **alternative extensions** or exploiting **server misconfigurations**

---
## Bypassing the Blacklist

### 1. Intercept and Modify Upload Request

- Use **Burp Suite** to:
    - Replace filename to `shell.phtml`
    - Replace file content with PHP shell
- If `File successfully uploaded` appears, the extension is allowed.

## Fuzzing File Extensions

### Tools & Wordlists

- **PayloadsAllTheThings**: PHP extensions
- **SecLists**: Common web file extensions

### Burp Intruder Setup

1. Send upload request to **Intruder**
2. Set payload position on `.php` part of `filename="HTB.php"`
3. Load list of PHP extensions
4. Disable URL Encoding for payloads
5. Start attack and observe response lengths

### Interpretation

- **Responses with same length** as success (e.g., 193) → Passed validation
- **Others** → Blocked due to blacklisting

---
## Exploitable Extensions

### Common Executable Extensions (PHP)

- `.phtml`
- `.php3`, `.php4`, `.php5`
- `.phar`, `.inc`, `.module`
Not all will execute on every server—test multiple options.

---

## Exploitation Steps Summary

1. **Find extension blacklist** via error response
2. **Fuzz for allowed extensions** using Intruder + wordlists
3. **Upload web shell** with a working extension (e.g., `.phtml`)
4. **Visit uploaded file** (e.g., `/profile_images/shell.phtml?cmd=id`)
5. **Confirm RCE** if command output is returned
