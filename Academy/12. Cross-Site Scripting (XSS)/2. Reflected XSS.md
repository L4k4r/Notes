Reflected XSS occurs when **user-supplied input** is immediately processed by the back-end server and **reflected back** in the HTTP response **without proper sanitization**.

This is a **Non-Persistent XSS**: the payload **does not get stored** and only executes when the crafted request is used.

---

1. User input is **sent to the server** (e.g., via GET request).
2. Server includes that input in the response (e.g., error message or confirmation).
3. If input is **not sanitized**, an **XSS payload executes** in the browser.

### **Testing Reflected XSS**

Inject a simple payload like:
```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
- If the alert appears → XSS is present.
Refreshing the page removes the alert → confirms **Reflected XSS** (Non-Persistent).

### **Exploiting Reflected XSS**

Since the payload isn't stored, to exploit this:
**Send a crafted URL** to the victim that includes the XSS payload in a GET parameter.
**Steps:**
1. Open Developer Tools → Network tab (`CTRL+Shift+I`).
2. Inject XSS and trigger the vulnerable request.
3. Copy the resulting URL (with the payload):
```html
http://example.com/page?input=<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
4. Send this URL to the target (phishing, social engineering, etc.).
