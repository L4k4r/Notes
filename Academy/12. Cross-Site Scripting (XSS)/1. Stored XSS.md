**Stored XSS** occurs when a malicious script is **permanently stored** on the target server (e.g., in a database) and **executed every time** a user loads the page containing that data.

---

### **Impact**

- Affects **multiple users**, not just the attacker.
- May require **manual removal** from the backend DB.
- Can be used to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Redirect users
    - Deface pages
    - Deliver malware

### **How to Identify Stored XSS*
1. **Enter basic input** (e.g., "test") into a form or input field.
2. **Check if it's reflected** back on the page.
3. Try injecting a **basic XSS payload**:
```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
If the alert box appears, **XSS is present**.


---

### **Why `alert(window.origin)` is used**
- Confirms **which domain** executed the script.
- Helps detect if XSS is in a sandboxed **iFrame** or on the **main page**.

Use other payloads if `alert()` is blocked or doesn't trigger:

| **Payload**                | **Effect**                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<script>print()</script>` | Opens the **print dialog** (less likely to be blocked) |
| `<plaintext>`              | Stops HTML rendering and dumps remaining page as text  |
