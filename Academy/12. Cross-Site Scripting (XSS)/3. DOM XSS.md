**DOM XSS** is a type of **Non-Persistent XSS** where **malicious input is never sent to the server**. Instead, it's **processed entirely in the browser** using JavaScript and the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.

---

- **Input** is passed through **client-side sources** (e.g., `window.location`, `document.URL`, etc.).
- JavaScript code on the page **inserts this input into the DOM** using functions like `innerHTML`, without proper sanitization.
- This allows **malicious JavaScript to be executed** when a crafted URL is opened.

### **Source & Sink Concept**

- **Source**: Where user input comes from  
    → e.g., `document.URL`, `location.hash`, `document.referrer`
- **Sink**: Where user input is written to the page  
    → e.g., `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `document.write()`
**If unfiltered data flows from source → sink**, XSS is possible.

### **DOM XSS Payload Example**

Standard `<script>` tags won't work here, so use alternative payloads:
```html
<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
- The broken image triggers `onerror`, which executes the `alert()`.
- Doesn’t require `<script>` tag, bypasses basic filters.

### **Exploiting DOM XSS**

To exploit:
1. Craft a URL like:
```html
http://example.com/#task=<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
2. Send the link to a victim.
3. When they open it, the payload executes in their browser.
