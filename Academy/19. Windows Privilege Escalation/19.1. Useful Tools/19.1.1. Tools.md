### **Core Enumeration Tools**

|**Tool**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|_Seatbelt_|C# tool for performing broad local privilege escalation checks|
|_winPEAS_|Enumerates escalation paths on Windows; outputs detailed, color-coded info|
|_PowerUp_|PowerShell tool for identifying and exploiting common Windows privilege escalation vectors|
|_SharpUp_|C# version of PowerUp|
|_JAWS_|PowerShell 2.0-based tool for discovering escalation vectors|
|_SessionGopher_|Extracts and decrypts saved sessions from tools like PuTTY, RDP, FileZilla|
|_Watson_|.NET tool to enumerate missing KB patches; suggests escalation exploits|
|_LaZagne_|Recovers local credentials from browsers, email clients, DBs, memory dumps, system config|
|_WES-NG_ (Windows Exploit Suggester)|Uses `systeminfo` output to determine missing patches and known exploits|
|_Sysinternals Suite_|Suite of tools; commonly used: _AccessChk_, _PipeList_, _PsService_|

### **Best Practices**

- **Preferred Upload Location**: `C:\Windows\Temp` â€“ writable by _BUILTIN\Users_
- **Recommended**: Compile tools from source for stealth and integrity
- **Manual enumeration** is essential to:
    - Avoid reliance on tools
    - Confirm/validate findings
    - Work in restricted environments (air-gapped, no USB/network access)

---

### **Limitations and Warnings**

- Tools may **overload with irrelevant data** (e.g., _winPEAS_ output)
- Risk of **false positives/negatives**
- **Understanding tool output** is key for efficiency
- **Execution may trigger antivirus/EDR detections**
    - Example: _LaZagne v2.4.3_ flagged by **47/70** AV engines on VirusTotal
        - Hash: `ed2f501408a7a6e1a854c29c4b0bc5648aaa8612432df829008931b3e34bf56`

### **AV/EDR Bypass Considerations**

- AVs may **block or quarantine** known binaries
- EDRs (e.g., _Cylance_, _Carbon Black_) provide **advanced behavioral detection**
- **Evasion Techniques** (out of scope for this module):
    - Remove comments
    - Rename functions
    - Encrypt/obfuscate payloads

---

### **Operational Guidance**

- During real assessments:
    - **Engage with clients** on whether AV/EDR will be disabled
    - **Understand** all tool functionality used
    - Be ready to **operate manually** if tools are unavailable or restricted
