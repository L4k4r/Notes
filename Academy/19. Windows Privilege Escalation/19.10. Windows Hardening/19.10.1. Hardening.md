### **Secure Clean OS Installation**

- Use clean ISO + deployment tools (e.g. _WDS_, _SCCM_)
- Base image should include:
    - Required applications
    - Security & functionality configuration changes
    - Pre-tested OS updates

- Benefits:
    - Removes bloatware
    - Standardized host config across enterprise
---

### **Updates and Patching**

- _Windows Update Orchestrator_ handles automatic updates
- Key update steps:
    1. Host scanned for updates
    2. Orchestrator matches needed updates
    3. Downloads initiated/stored in temp
    4. Installer agent applies updates
    5. Finalized with reboot

- Enterprise solutions:
    - _WSUS_ server to centralize update distribution
    - _GPO_ to manage update policy
- **Best practice**: test updates on dev hosts before enterprise-wide rollout


---

### **Configuration Management**

- _Group Policy_ allows centralized config management
- Tools:
    - GPMC (GUI)
    - PowerShell (CLI)
- Can manage:
    - User settings (wallpapers, bookmarks)
    - Windows Defender behavior
    - Update scheduling
- Works best in AD environments; local GPO available otherwise

---

### **User Management**

- Limit local & domain admin accounts
- Enable logging of login attempts (valid/invalid)
- Enforce strong password policies:
    - Complexity
    - History
    - Rotation

- Enforce 2FA (something you _know_ + something you _have_)
- Restrict excessive group memberships
- Login restrictions for admin accounts

---

### **Audit**

- Use security baselines:
    - _DISA STIGs_, _Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit_
    - Compliance: _ISO27001_, _PCI-DSS_, _HIPAA_

- Auditing tools:
    - _STIG Viewer_ (visual audit tool with checklists)

- Combine with:
    - Penetration tests
    - Vulnerability scans
    - Manual config reviews

---

### **Logging**

#### **Sysmon**

- Logs:
    - Processes
    - File I/O
    - Network activity
    - Logins
- Logs stored at:
    - `Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\Sysmon\Operational`
- Can be integrated with SIEM for correlation/alerting

#### **Network Logs**

- Tools: _Packetbeat_, _Security Onion_, IDS/IPS solutions
- Complements Sysmon by monitoring network-level events

---

### **Key Hardening Measures**

- Enable _Secure Boot_ and _BitLocker_
- Audit writable files & executables with launch capability
- Use absolute paths in scheduled tasks with elevated rights
- Avoid cleartext creds in shared/host files
- Clean PowerShell history & home dirs
- Prevent low-privileged users from modifying custom libraries
- Remove unnecessary services/packages
- Utilize _Device Guard_ & _Credential Guard_
- Use _GPO_ to enforce config

---

### **Conclusion**

- Privilege escalation techniques vary (misconfigs, exploits, binaries)
- Once SYSTEM is achieved, pivoting becomes easier
- Combine manual + automated validation (e.g. Nessus)
- Train staff continuously to stay ahead of threats
- Always balance security with business functionality
