### **Key Concept**

- Escalation often comes through _interacting with running processes_, especially those running with higher privileges.
- Common targets: web servers, logging agents, internal services running as SYSTEM or Administrator.

---

### **Access Tokens**

- Define security context of a process/thread
- Contain identity, group membership, privileges
- Copied to all child processes
- Often abused via _token impersonation_ (e.g., Juicy Potato, Rogue Potato)

---

### **Enumerating Network Services**

- Use: `netstat -ano`
- Focus on:
    - **127.0.0.1 / ::1**-bound services (loopback-only)
    - Services not bound to 0.0.0.0 or external IPs

- Targets may include:
    - FileZilla Admin Interface (port 14147)
    - Splunk Universal Forwarder (unauthenticated code execution as SYSTEM)
    - Erlang Port Mapper (port 25672) — abused via weak/known cookie values

---

### **Named Pipes**

- In-memory files used for inter-process communication (IPC)
- Types:
    - _Named Pipes_ — persistent name under `\\.\pipe\`
    - _Anonymous Pipes_ — unnamed, for parent-child IPC

- Communication:
    - Duplex (bi-directional)
    - Half-duplex (uni-directional)

---

### **Tools for Named Pipe Enumeration**

- `pipelist.exe` (Sysinternals)
- PowerShell: `gci \\.\pipe\`
- Check for odd or custom-named pipes (e.g., `mojo`, `msagent_*`)

---

### **Named Pipe Permissions**

- Use: `accesschk.exe /accepteula \\.\pipe\<pipe-name> -v`
- Review **DACLs**:
    - _Everyone_ or _Authenticated Users_ with RW = vulnerable
    - _FILE_ALL_ACCESS_ indicates full control

---

### **Named Pipe Attack Example: WindscribeService**

- Pipe: `\\.\pipe\WindscribeService`
- Tool: `accesschk.exe -w \\.\pipe\* -v`
- Output:
    - Everyone: _FILE_ALL_ACCESS_
    - Allows all users to read/write/execute over the pipe

- Result: Escalation to SYSTEM via malicious interaction with WindscribeService

---

### **Practical Exploits to Review**

- **SplunkWhisperer2**: Abuse Splunk Universal Forwarder
- **Erlang Cookie Reuse**: Pivot via RabbitMQ/CouchDB
- **Juicy/Rogue/Lonely Potato**: Token impersonation when SeImpersonate privilege is present
