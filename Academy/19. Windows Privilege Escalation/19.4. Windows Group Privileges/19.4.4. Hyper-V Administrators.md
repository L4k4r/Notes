### **Overview**

- _Hyper-V Administrators_ have full control over Hyper-V features.
- If Domain Controllers are virtualized, Hyper-V Admins should be treated as _Domain Admins_.
- They can clone Domain Controllers and extract the _NTDS.dit_ file to obtain _NTLM password hashes_.

### **Attack Vector: VM Deletion & Hard Link Abuse**

#### **Key Concept**

- On VM deletion, `vmms.exe` (runs as _NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM_) restores original permissions on the `.vhdx` file.
- Vulnerability: No impersonation â†’ hard link to SYSTEM file results in elevated access.

#### **Exploitable Conditions**

- System vulnerable to:
    - _CVE-2018-0952_
    - _CVE-2019-0841_

#### **Steps:**

1. **Delete Target `.vhdx` File**
2. **Create Native Hard Link**
    - Redirects the deleted VM disk path to a protected SYSTEM file.

3. **Example Target File**
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe`

4. **Run Exploit Script**
    - Grants current user _full permissions_ on the target file.

### **Execution: Gaining SYSTEM Access**

#### **1. Take Ownership**
```powershell
takeown /F "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe"
```

#### **2. Replace with Malicious Binary**

#### **3. Start Vulnerable Service**
```powershell
sc.exe start MozillaMaintenance
```
- Executes the malicious binary as _SYSTEM_.

### **Mitigations**

- March 2020 security updates address this attack by hardening behavior around _NTFS hard links_.
