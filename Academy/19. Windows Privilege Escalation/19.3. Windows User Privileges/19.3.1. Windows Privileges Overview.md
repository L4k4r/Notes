### **Privileges vs. Access Rights**

- _Privileges_: Rights assigned to users/groups to perform system-level tasks (e.g., shutdown, debug, impersonate)
- _Access Rights_: Control access to securable objects (files, folders, registry, etc.)
- Stored in a userâ€™s _access token_ upon logon
- Privileges vary by local system or domain context

### **Windows Authorization Process**

- **Security Principals**: Users, computers, processes with unique _SIDs_
- **Access Token**: Contains:
    - User SID
    - Group SIDs
    - List of privileges
    - Other access info

- **Authorization Flow**:
    - User tries to access a resource
    - System compares token with object's **DACL/ACE**
    - Access granted/denied based on match

### **Important Privileged Groups**

|Group|Description|
|---|---|
|_Administrators_|Includes Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins|
|_Server Operators_|Manage services, SMB shares, and backups|
|_Backup Operators_|Local login to DCs, backup SAM/NTDS, registry read|
|_Print Operators_|Can load drivers (potential LPE)|
|_Hyper-V Administrators_|Considered DA if managing virtual DCs|
|_Account Operators_|Modify non-protected accounts/groups|
|_Remote Desktop Users_|Often assigned rights to log in remotely|
|_Remote Management Users_|Log into DCs with PSRemoting|
|_Group Policy Creator Owners_|Create GPOs (needs additional delegation)|
|_Schema Admins_|Modify AD schema (high impact)|
|_DNS Admins_|Can load malicious DLLs or create WPAD records|

### **Checking Privileges**

- Command: `whoami /priv`
- _Disabled_: Present in token but not currently active
- _Enabled_: Privilege is currently usable
- Many privileges are **only available when running as an elevated user**

---

### **Examples of Privileges by User Type**

**Admin (Elevated):**

- Has critical privileges like:
    - `SeDebugPrivilege`
    - `SeBackupPrivilege`
    - `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`
    - `SeImpersonatePrivilege`

- Many are _Disabled_ by default, must be explicitly enabled in session

**Standard User:**
- Very limited:
    - `SeChangeNotifyPrivilege` (Enabled)
    - `SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege` (Disabled)

**Backup Operator:**

- Example shows:
    - `SeShutdownPrivilege`
    - May also have other rights restricted by UAC

### **Detection**

- Monitor **Event ID 4672** for "Special privileges assigned to new logon"
- Flag unexpected privilege assignments or sensitive rights assigned to low-privilege accounts

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- Privileges are powerful tools often overlooked
- Misconfigured group memberships or delegated privileges can enable escalation
- Understanding these allows for both _a_
