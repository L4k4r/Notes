RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is commonly used in Windows networks for remote access. We can transfer files using RDP by copying and pasting. We can right-click and copy a file from the Windows machine we connect to and paste it into the RDP session.

If we are connected from Linux, we can use `xfreerdp` or `rdesktop`. At the time of writing, `xfreerdp` and `rdesktop` allow copy from our target machine to the RDP session, but there may be scenarios where this may not work as expected.

As an alternative to copy and paste, we can mount a local resource on the target RDP server. `rdesktop` or `xfreerdp` can be used to expose a local folder in the remote RDP session.

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop

```bash
rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
```

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp
```bash
xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
```

To access the directory, we can connect to `\\tsclient\`, allowing us to transfer files to and from the RDP session.
