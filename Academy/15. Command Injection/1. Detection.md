### Overview

- **Basic command injection** occurs when user input is passed **directly into system commands** without sanitization.
- Detection = **Exploitation attempt**: If output changes or reveals command execution, the target is vulnerable.
- Detection is done **without source code**, relying on behavior and output changes.

---

## Detection Method

### Example Scenario

- Web utility: **Host Checker**
- Expected command behind the scenes:
```bash
ping -c 1 OUR_INPUT
```

### Hypothesis
- If `OUR_INPUT` is not sanitized, we can inject arbitrary commands.

## Command Injection Operators

| Operator   | Character(s) | URL-Encoded | Behavior                               |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Semicolon  | `;`          | `%3b`       | Executes both commands                 |
| New Line   | `\n`         | `%0a`       | Executes both commands                 |
| Background | `&`          | `%26`       | Executes both, second may return first |
| Pipe       | `            | `           | `%7c`                                  |
| AND        | `&&`         | `%26%26`    | Second only if first succeeds          |
| OR         | `            |             | `                                      |
| Sub-shell  |              | `%60%60`    | Executes inside sub-shell (Linux-only) |
| Sub-shell  | `$()`        | `%24%28%29` | Executes inside sub-shell (Linux-only) |

## Platform Considerations

- Works across:
    
    - **PHP**, **NodeJS**, **.NET**, etc.
    - **Linux**, **Windows**, **macOS**
        
- Exceptions:
    
    - **Semicolon `;`** does _not_ work in **Windows CMD**
    - Sub-shells (`` or `$()`) are **Linux/macOS-only**

---

## Detection Strategy

1. Input normal value (e.g., `127.0.0.1`) to confirm behavior
    
2. Append injection operator + command:
    - `127.0.0.1; whoami`
    - `127.0.0.1 && id`
    - `127.0.0.1 | uname -a`
3. Analyze output for signs of:
    - Command output
    - Change in expected behavior
4. Use **URL-encoding** to avoid client-side blocks (e.g., `%3b` for `;`)

---
## Tip

- Even without source code, output behavior + controlled input = enough to detect injection.
- Use **multiple injection styles** to confirm:
    - If one fails (e.g., `;`), try others (`&&`, `|`, `\n`, etc.)
